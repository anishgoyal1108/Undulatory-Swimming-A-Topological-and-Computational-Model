- The MATLab Synaptic Model implements a histogram-based Naive Bayes classifier tailored for analyzing synaptic data. It takes input from a file named "synaptic_data.txt" containing synaptic data, where each line represents a synaptic event with a corresponding time value. The code trains the classifier by binning the time values into a specified number of Gaussian bins and calculating the probability of occurrence for each bin. Then, it calculates the conditional probability of synaptic values given the time bins, considering the number of occurrences
within each time bin. However, it does not account for occurrences where no events are recorded. This model is designed to infer synaptic values based solely on the time of occurrences, 
ignoring periods without events.
-  The ROS (Robot Operating System) , involves reading synaptic data from a file and utilizing it to determine motor speed. The script defines a function to read synaptic data from a file, and a callback function to process the received synaptic data message, determining motor speed based on the synaptic value (# of occurences/time, defined by the Synaptic Model).
- The Topological Model defines constants  time step, water density, and viscosity, along with a function to initialize the velocity field with a specific shape. The script then initializes the velocity fields using the defined function and creates a meshgrid representing the spatial coordinates. Finally, it generates a quiver plot to visualize the velocity vectors in the 3D space, where each arrow represents the velocity at a specific point in the grid. The resulting plot provides insights into the velocity distribution within the simulated environment.
